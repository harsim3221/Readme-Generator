# Readme-Generator

## User Requirements
As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

## Acceptance criteria
Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
The title of my project
Sections entitled:
- Description
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests
- Contact Information

When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README.
When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README.
